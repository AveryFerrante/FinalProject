== The Study of Organic Chemistry ==
Organic chemistry is primarily devoted to the unique properties of the carbon atom and its compounds.  These compounds play a critical role in biology and ecology, Earth sciences and geology, physics, industry, medicine and &amp;mdash; of course &amp;mdash; chemistry.  At first glance, the new material that organic chemistry brings to the table may seem complicated and daunting, but all it takes is concentration and perseverance.  Millions of students before you have successfully passed this course and you can too!

This field of chemistry is based less on formulas and more on reactions between various molecules under different conditions. Whereas a typical general chemistry question may ask a student to compute an answer with an equation from the chapter that they memorized, a more typical organic chemistry question is along the lines of &quot;what product will form when substance X is treated with solution Y and bombarded by light&quot;. The key to learning organic chemistry is to ''understand'' it rather than cram it in the night before a test.  It is all well and good to memorize the mechanism of Michael addition, but a superior accomplishment would be the ability to explain ''why'' such a reaction would take place.

As in all things, it is easier to build up a body of new knowledge on a foundation of solid prior knowledge.  Students will be well served by much of the knowledge brought to this subject from the subject of [[General Chemistry]].  Concepts with particular importance to organic chemists are covalent bonding, Molecular Orbit theory, VSEPR Modeling, understanding acid/base chemistry vis-a-vis pKa values, and even trends of the periodic table.  This is by no means a comprehensive list of the knowledge you should have gained already in order to fully understand the subject of organic chemistry, but it should give you some idea of the things you need to know to succeed in an organic chemistry test or course.

Organic Chemistry is one of the subjects which are varying useful and close to our daily life. We always try to figure out some of the unknown mysteries of our daily life through our factious  thinking habit, which generates superstitions. Through the help of chemistry we can help ourselves to get out of this kind of superstition.							
We always try to find the ultimate truth through our own convenience. In the ancient past we had struggled to make things to go as per our need. In that context we have found fire, house, food, transportation, etc…

Now the burning question is: &quot;how can chemistry help our daily life?&quot;  To find the answer of this questions, we have to know the subject thoroughly.  Let us start it from now.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:38, 31 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:04, 31 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

::[[Optimal Classification]] was originally published in the Wikipedia in May of 2007. It contained an unwikified primary reference that was wikified as an inline reference, along with several notes. It had two minor typo's, which were corrected and wiki graphic tables which made it larger than necessary. The graphics were converted to images and the size reduced. Currently references and notes are being expanded and text added to clarify the theoretical and empirical separatory equations. It is a work in progress.
::It was moved from the Wikipedia to the Wikibooks because Wikipedia user Jiuguang Wang read a Wikia article by the original author of the Wikipedia article which he rejected due to his being raised in Beijing as a Chinese Communist and as an atheist prior to moving to Atlanta in 2000 when he was 12. The Wikia article uses logic to both define, support and defend the existence of God.
::In line with his rejection of the Wikia article he rejected the [[Optimal Classification]] article as a hoax and nominated it for deletion on the Wikipedia. Proof that the article is not original research can be found by reading the primary reference while the notability of the subject can be verified by reading the references the primary reference contains. 
::I am contacting you because user Jiuguang Wang along with a Wikipedia administrator have now nominated the [[Optimal Classification]] ''book'' for deletion as a continuation of their harassment and personal attack against the Wikipedia author and since I have never been through a nomination for deletion experience I do not know how to post a vote to keep this book from being deleted. Your help is needed and will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. [[User:Typetive|Typative]] ([[User talk:Typetive|talk]]) 22:32, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

*{{keep}} Two points worth noting: First, a person's behavior on Wikipedia does not matter here at Wikibooks. When he comes here, he has a blank slate and is not to be punished for his behavior elsewhere. This is most true of Wikipedia, which is known to have a very tough and incompassionate system of justice. Second, transwiking from Wikipedia to Wikibooks ''might be the right thing to do'' since the two projects have very different inclusion criteria. The idea of classification, and the idea of an optimal classification scheme are not unique nor original. This topic is an important one in the field of computer science (and less important but still pertinant for other fields). Wikibook's notion of &quot;original research&quot; is different from that at WP, and I do not believe this book to be in violation of our policies. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:51, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

: Can you elaborate on WikiBooks' policy on original research? At the previous AfD, concerned were raised over the &quot;references&quot; provided in the article in that they do not actually provide references for the materials in the article. You are right - optimal classification is an important ''idea'', but the article here is about an algorithm the editor invented. The cited works (by Rypka) contains no mentions of an ''algorithm'' called optimal classification. As for the behavior - should I assume that calling another editor &quot;...Chinese Communist Beijing as an atheist&quot; do not constitute a personal attack here? --[[User:Jiuguang Wang|Jiuguang Wang]] ([[User talk:Jiuguang Wang|talk]]) 23:02, 31 July 2008 (UTC)

::If the editor has made a personal attack, we will deal with that elsewhere. It is not the purpose of VFD to examine behavior issues, and we will not make deletion decisions based on them.
::Wikibook's OR policy is far less restrictive then that at WP. We don't require references (although they are always appreciated), because books tend not to have them in the same way that Encyclopediae do. Books will have biblography, however, and we encourage that. We require that books be ''verifiable'', either through normal references/bibliography, common knowledge, or self reproduction. If a result can be reproduced faithfully by a reader, it satisfies our criteria. Because of the verifiability requirement, books tend to build from easy results which are obvious to results which are not. However, since books are works in progress, we can't expect new books to contain all the necessary scaffolding to support later results. Ideally, that scaffolding will be added eventually. Is this enough information for you? --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:14, 31 July 2008 (UTC)
::: Yes, thank you. I would still like to know in what way this article is verifiable, though - the original editor would argue that it is verifiable by Rypka's work, except I cannot find anything online or in books that matches the statements and equations in the article (please provide a page number?) The work has also not been peer-reviewed elsewhere. --[[User:Jiuguang Wang|Jiuguang Wang]] ([[User talk:Jiuguang Wang|talk]]) 23:27, 31 July 2008 (UTC)
::::Okay, and we can take those kinds of criticisms into account later. All books have problems, new books especially so. We can't damn a book for being imperfect before it's even a week old (and not even then, usually). What this book needs is time to improve. If you've read relevant works in the area, are familiar with the subject, and are obviously taking the time to post comments here, maybe you would be interested in helping this book to grow correctly? Small books need all the help they can get. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:00, 1 August 2008 (UTC)
:::::What was &quot;''invented''&quot; by Dr. Rypka and his team, which included scientists from the former Soviet Union, were the theoretical and empirical separatory equations. The &quot;''algorithm''&quot; is merely the application of the equations to static or incoming dynamic data. The word &quot;''optimal''&quot; as explained in the text is used throughout Dr. Rypka's work to denote the ''type'' of classification along with the word &quot;''continuous''.&quot; Contrary to the statements of User:Jiuguang Wang, on page 161 of the Primary reference can be found a photocopy of the Burroughs 5700 Time Sharing Service Terminal printout and a full description of the algorithms which implement the separatory equations. Elucidating the equations by describing each of their variables is hardly original research. Rather it is the equivalent of paraphrasing the text of Dr. Rypka's work. You will have to obtain and read a copy of his publication to understand the reason for use of the word &quot;optimal&quot; in the name of the book's title since I do not have permission (''yet'') from the publisher to publish a photocopy of Dr. Rypka's work here or in the Wikipedia. What disturbs me most however is that [[User:Jiuguang Wang|Jiuguang Wang]] would nominate an article for deletion without reading the primary reference or the references it contains. It would be the equivalent of an anthropologist going into the jungle, seeing a skeleton he had never seen before and for that reason taking a mallet to it.

*{{keep}}, but revisit. He's only had just over 3 days to work on it, and textbook materials take a lot more time to develop than wikipedia articles (we also don't have the same sorts of notability requirements). If it ''is'' original research in the sense of an interpretation or extrapolation, it can be transwikied to Wikiversity for further development. I recommend closing the VfD for at least a few weeks to see what can be made of the text without undue pressure. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:54, 31 July 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}}, as per SBJ.  It doesn't sit well with me that two people create accounts here apparently for the sole purpose of nominating a new book for a VfD and voting on it. I view such activity with a jaundiced eye.  I have a difficult time believing they intend to become a regular, constructive part of this community once this issue is resolved.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:10, 1 August 2008 (UTC)
* [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' The background history to this over at Wikipedia is somewhat disturbing and doesn't really make anyone look particularly good. It seems like people are taking this very personally. I agree with Whiteknight, SB_Johnny and Jomegat. Let's close this for now and give it some time to develop. Perhaps this should eventually move to Wikiversity. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:07, 1 August 2008 (UTC)
*[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' per jwt.--[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 08:00, 1 August 2008 (UTC)
*[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''-This can, of course, be greatly improved but lets give them some more time. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 22:12, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome message ==

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

There is a small issue with the [[Feminism/Mary Wollstonecraft?]] page and the use of Wikipedia content (copy-paste) into Wikibooks, license requires that you give attribution to Wikipedia on the book that uses the content or that as transwiki is performed (so to import edit history), you can do the first or undo the last change and request a transwiki (remember also to fix Wikilinks if you can). In any case good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:34, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

== Rename ==

You can request a rename at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance/Renaming]]. Welcome to Wikibooks and happy editing. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 08:15, 25 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A mass oscillating on a spring in a gravity-free vacuum has two sorts of energy: kinetic energy and elastic (potential) energy. Kinetic energy is given by:

&lt;math&gt;E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2&lt;/math&gt;

Elastic energy, or elastic potential energy, is given by:

&lt;math&gt;E_e = \frac{1}{2}kx^2&lt;/math&gt;

So, the total energy stored by the oscillator is:

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma E = \frac{1}{2}(mv^2 + kx^2)&lt;/math&gt;

This total energy is constant. However, the proportions of this energy which are kinetic and elastic change over time, since v and x change with time. If we give a spring a displacement, it has no kinetic energy, and a certain amount of elastic energy. If we let it go, that elastic energy is all converted into kinetic energy, and so, when the mass reaches its initial position, it has no elastic energy, and all the elastic energy it did have has been converted into kinetic energy. As the mass continues to travel, it is slowed by the spring, and so the kinetic energy is converted back into elastic energy - the same amount of elastic energy as it started out. The nature of the energy oscillates back and forth, but the total energy is constant.

If the mass is oscillating vertically in a gravitational field, the situation gets more complicated since the spring now has gravitational potential energy, elastic potential energy and kinetic energy. However, it turns out (if you do the maths) that the total energy is still constant, although the equilibrium position will be lower.

==Questions==

1. A 10g mass causes a spring to extend 5cm. How much energy is stored by the spring?

2. A 500g mass on a spring (k=100) is extended by 0.2m, and begins to oscillate in an otherwise empty universe. What is the maximum velocity which it reaches?

3. Another 500g mass on another spring in another otherwise empty universe is extended by 0.5m, and begins to oscillate. If it reaches a maximum velocity of 15ms&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, what is the spring constant of the spring?

4. Draw graphs of the kinetic and elastic energies of a mass on a spring (ignoring gravity).

5. Use the trigonometric formulae for x and v to derive an equation for the total energy stored by an oscillating mass on a spring, ignoring gravity and air resistance, which is constant with respect to time.

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = 0.5 \times 1.962 \times 0.05^2 = 2.45\mbox{ mJ}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;k = \frac{mv_{max}^2}{x_{max}^2} = \frac{0.5 \times 15^2}{0.5^2} = 450\mbox{ Nm}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. Draw graphs of the kinetic and elastic energies of a mass on a spring (ignoring gravity).'''

&lt;math&gt;E_e \propto \cos^2 \omega t&lt;/math&gt;

'''5. Use the trigonometric formulae for x and v to derive an equation for the total energy stored by an oscillating mass on a spring, ignoring gravity and air resistance, which is constant with respect to time.'''

&lt;math&gt;x = A\cos{\omega t}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v = -A\omega\sin{\omega t}&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute these into the equation for the total energy:

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma E = \frac{1}{2}(kx^2 + mv^2) = \frac{1}{2}(k(A\cos{\omega t})^2 + m(-A\omega\sin{\omega t})^2) = \frac{1}{2}(kA^2\cos^2{\omega t} + mA^2\omega^2\sin^2{\omega t}) = \frac{A^2}{2}(k\cos^2{\omega t} + m\omega^2\sin^2{\omega t})&lt;/math&gt;

We know that:

&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 = \frac{k}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

By substitution:

&lt;math&gt;\Sigma E = \frac{A^2}{2}(k\cos^2{\omega t} + \frac{mk}{m}\sin^2{\omega t}) = \frac{A^2}{2}(k\cos^2{\omega t} + k\sin^2{\omega t}) = \frac{kA^2}{2}(\cos^2{\omega t} + \sin^2{\omega t}) = \frac{kA^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* Celebrating the New Moon */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Scriptual Precedent==
&quot;God said, 'Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate day from night; they shall serve as signs for the set times - the days and the years; and they shall serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth.' And it was so. God made the two great lights, the greater light to dominate the day and the lesser light to dominate the night, and the stars.&quot; Gen.1:14-16

These two great lights are the sun, and the moon, respectively.  The word for 'set times' here is moedim (appointed times) which is the very word that Yahweh chooses to use to describe His festivals.  One more passage that speaks of these two lights is found in Psalms 104:19:  &quot;He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows when to set.&quot;   

This passage clearly sets the moon apart as the main marker of the seasons, while the sun is to mark the day. The moon that reflects the light of the Sun confirms throughout the month as it waxes and wanes that the created order is not chaotic.  Its visible rebirth each month is very orderly and precise, but not absolutely predictable. Therefore, each month has a degree of expectancy about it. 

==The Ordination of the New Moon==
The months in the Sacred calendar are established as lunar months.  Therefore the sighting of the new moon was ordained to establish the beginning of the monthly cycle and therefore the first day of the month.   The moon's full cycle of illumination lasts a little over 29 days. Thus we have our biblical months of either 29 or 30 days.

The New Moon is a precise astronomical event and can occur on different days because of the rotation of the earth. The determination of the New Moon, therefore, must be determined from the time in which it occurs in Jerusalem to ensure the uniformity of religious worship throughout the world, given increased communication. 

This is based upon scripture which places Jerusalem as the throne of Yahweh (Jeremiah 3:17), the centre-point of the law which will be given under Messiah (Isaiah 2: 3)  through the waters of the Spirit (Zechariah 8:22; 14:8-21). 
God has placed His name there for ever (2 Chronicles 33: 4)
Before the time of modern calendars, the new moon was vitally important as it was the official announcement of when the new month had begun.  Because Yahweh gave commandment to observe the feasts and festivals in their given times it was vital to keep accurate count of when the new month began to celebrate the festivals correctly. 
 
“Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying:  Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them:  Yahweh’s appointed festivals that you are to designate as holy convocations — these are My appointed festivals.”  (Leviticus 23:1-2)   “These are the appointed festivals of Yahweh, the holy convocations, which you shall designate in their appropriate time.”  (Leviticus 23:4). 
 
God is very clear that the festivals are to be celebrated not because they are for man but because they are His appointed times.  These festivals are holy not because man makes them so, but because Yahweh Himself declares them holy.  Since Yahweh is the One who instituted them, it is a reasonable act of worship and obedience to observe them when He designated.

The Sanhedrin, which was the council of elders in Israel, would confirm the sighting of the new moon based upon reliable witnesses and shofars were blown in accordance with the scripture to announce the beginning of the month. 
Today, the rabbinical calendar is based on calculations set up by Rabbi Hillel the second in the mid fourth century. Around this time, the Sanhedrin (the high court of ancient Israel) ceased to exist.  Hillel felt that the New Moon could not be declared visually without a Sanhedrin to affirm its sighting, so he decided it must be calculated.  Rabbis now know that Hillel's calculations were/are off, sometimes as much as two days, which means the festivals are not celebrated on the correct day.  But they have decided to wait until a Sanhedrin is established again to change it. 

==The Ordination of the New Year==
The annual calendar is set by the alignment of both the monthly lunar cycle and the annual solar cycle.  The lunar cycle sets the seasons based on the solar equinoctal cycle.  The moon and sun together are governing signs.
God’s Sacred Year begins with Abib or Nisan (Exodus 12:1-2).
  
&quot;And Yahweh spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,  This month [Abib] shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you&quot;. (KJV)

This is determined from the New Moon nearest to the spring equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, which begins the summer season,(Note all scholars within the Hebrew Roots believe this statement is totally correct. Herb Solinski who has researched this quite indepth says this should be the new moon crescent on or after the vernal equinox , www.biblicalcalendar.org . At this website you will find his sources quoted in 300 plus pages of documentation) at which time the barley crop will be &quot;in the green&quot; ready for harvest at Passover. This month Abib or Nisan was to be the first of months and, hence, its determination would set the start and finish of the year and, hence, the calendar. The autumnal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere begins the winter season. These are the two seasons mentioned by the Bible which are used to determine the beginning of the year to coincide with the festival harvests.  (Genesis 8:22; Psalm 74:17)    The day of the New Year is to be kept as a solemn feast day.
A record of the festival of the New Moon is found in the Temple Scroll (11Q19-20). In column 14 we see that the sacrifices for the first day of the month, that is the New Moon, are listed, as are the special instructions for the New Year of the first day of the First Month. Thus, the Dead Sea Scrolls quite clearly identify the New Moon of the First Month (Nisan) as the New Year and as a day of solemn assembly and sacrifice. These ordinances are followed by the requirements for the seven day purification of the annual ordination of the priesthood.   This is what column 14 says of the New Year of Nisan:   &quot;On the first day of the [first] mon[th falls the beginning of months; for you it is the beginning of the months] of the year. [You are to do] no work, [You shall offer .. .. ..&quot;

Judaism changed the New Year from Nisan to Tishri, which is the seventh month, based on a man-made system derived from the rabbinical determinations introduced from Babylon in 344 CE and sanctioned by Rabbi Hillel II in 358 CE..  The Dead Sea Scrolls, the LXX and modern scholarship have exposed this change which was made.  However, even rabbinical scholars such as Rabbi Kohn, the Chief Rabbi of Budapest writing in 1894, states categorically that the New Year of Rosh haShanah in Tishri is a late third century post Temple period innovation (Sabbatarians in Transylvania, CCG Publishing, 1998, p. v et. seq).
The Bible gives instruction that Israel kept, as we are to keep, the Feast of Nisan (New Year's Day) as a feast day.

==Sighting the New Moon==
Various factors such as  atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity along the light path, altitude, latitude and longitude, fog, cloud/dust cover, glare etc. can all affect a first sighting.  No one can infallibly predict the moment when the new moon will become visible to the naked eye.  The general consensus of authoritative opinion is that a first sighting of the new moon could occur any time between about 15 and 48 hours after a conjunction.  The conjunction being when the earth is between the sun and the moon in perfect alignment.  The first sighting of the moon will be after the moon has moved out of this alignment.

In sighting the New Moon, one faces the western sky at sunset, drawing an imaginary line from the zenith overhead toward the setting sun, seeking the thin scimitar of light on either side of this imaginary line.  The sun sets in the west slightly right of where the new moon will be seen. As the sky darkens the first star is seen which is actually the planet Venus.  Gradually the crescent appears as a sliver just above the horizon.  The faint New Moon will bulge out to the right, with the horns pointing toward the left.  However, in early spring (autumn in southern hemisphere) the “Passover moon” will appear much like a saucer with both horns pointing upward.  Variations of this New Moon may be seen in springtime.  Biblical months are either 29 or 30 alternating days in length; at times two consecutive 30-day months may occur.  Only on the new moon will the moon be invisible until the sun sets.  It is as if Yahweh is concealing it so we will intentionally have to look for His sign in the sky.  

==Determining the New Year==
The New Year is determined by the New Moon which falls nearest the equinox, which ensures that the Full Moon falls after the equinox, while the sun stands in the sign of Aries.  In the Gregorian system the equinox can fall on 21-23 March.   The earliest date for the New Year has to be 14 days before 21 March, so that Passover will be at the full moon – i.e. 8 March. This was the earliest date for 1 Nisan. The latest date is determined by 15 Nisan and the sun in Aries. The sun leaves Aries on 19 April.  Thus, the day 19/20 April is the last day in which Passover can begin.  The 15th Nisan cannot be later than 20/21 April.   According to the ancient rules of the Hebrews, 1 Nisan, or the start of the sacred year, was not earlier than 8 March and not later than the Hebrew day on 8/9 April (Gregorian) in the case of a thirty day month falling with an equinox on 23 March.   It is impossible, therefore, for there to be a Passover earlier than the vernal equinox (21 March) or one later than 20/21 April.

Philo, the Jewish historian and contemporary of Yeshua the Messiah and the apostles, says that Moses established the moon of the vernal equinox as the first month of the year (The Works of Philo, On the Life of Moses II, chapter XLI, Part 222 and 224)  Josephus the Jewish historian also confirms this and defines it as &quot;when the sun was in Aries&quot; (Josephus, Ant. 3.201; III.x.5].

Because harvests are governed by the seasons, which are controlled by the movements of the heavenly bodies, the maturity of the barley crop in Israel will coincide with these calculations and is the necessary factor for establishing the new year so that there is the required grain to be offered at Firstfruits.

==Historical Observance of the Feast==
Psalm 81 tells us that Joseph instituted the Rosh Chodesh during his tenure as the viceroy of Egypt.  Joseph had the power to declare the decree and the people of Egypt, principally the sons of Israel, were delighted to make the recognition of the new moon as a joyful feast. The testimony was to honor Joseph for what he did as a righteous deliverer, who in many ways prefigured the coming Messiah of Israel and the redemption that He would ultimately bring.  All of Yahweh's feasts are a role play of eternal truths in His eternal purposes and keep His redemptive plan before us.   What Joseph set in place as a testimony,  has been established as a &quot;statute for Israel, a law of the God of Jacob&quot; (Psalm 81: 3-4)

In numbers 10:10 it is recorded that the trumpet is to be blown to sanctify the new Moon as a feast day.   &quot;At the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to Yahweh: .. ..  this is the burnt offering of each month throughout the months of the year .. .. it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.   (Numbers 28:11-15 RSV)
Moses called the people to assembly on the new moon and spoke to them according to the commandments he had been given by Yahweh, exhorting them to faith and obedience.  (Deuteronomy 1: 3)   It is also recorded that Yahweh chose this sabbatical day to speak to Moses and give him instructions for Israel.  Numbers 1: 1-5

Moses commanded the keeping of the new Moons.  2 Chronicles 8:12-13
Solomon said that it, as well as the other feasts, were &quot;an ordinance forever to Israel&quot;   2 Chronicles 2: 3-4

The kings of Israel kept the feast of the new moon with its stipulated temple procedure.   1 Chron. 23:31; 2 Chron. 31: 3

We find a record that Saul held feasts on the new moon, according to the law.  When Saul turned against David and he fled and hid in the country, David gave instructions to explain his absence from the feast, indicating that this was a day when David would be missed, if he did not attend the King’s table on the New Moon.  (1 Samuel 20:4-18, 24) 

It was usual during the Temple period to seek guidance from the prophets on the New Moons.  ( 2 Kings 4:23)

In the restoration of the law under Nehemiah the New Moons were re-instituted and kept from that time through to the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE.   Josephus records that they were kept during the entire Temple period and the High Priest attended in the Temple on the New Moons and Sabbaths. 
 
The New Testament church also understood them, hence the reference in Colossians chapter 2 when the Gnostics were criticising them for their festivities, contrary to their ascetic practices. &quot;Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a sabbath&quot;. (Colossians 2:16 RSV)

The Church of God kept it for centuries. We know that at the Reformation the true followers of Messiah were still keeping the entire sacred calendar intact, as it was in the Temple period.

During the Millennium, the Sabbaths and New Moons will be kept.  Isaiah tells us the entire world will be honoring the New Moons and the Sabbaths as they worship Yahweh in the coming Kingdom.  &quot;From new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says Yahweh&quot;. (Isaiah 66:23 RSV)  -  see Zech. 14:16-19

Also in Ezekiel 45:17   - the aspect of temple service for the new moons in the millennium
:::::46: 1,3 - enforcement of the New Moon as a sabbath and for worship

As sincere followers of Yahweh’s word, we should be observing them now and preparing ourselves as His Bride, fully adorned in all righteousness.

==The Significance of the New Moon Celebration==
The word used for New Moon in Hebrew is  'Rosh Chodesh' literally means “beginning, head, or renewal” and thus. the beginning or head of the month.  It is a time of spiritual renewal.

All through the scriptural record, the New Moon was a day when the prophets heard from Yahweh, being a day designated for waiting upon Yahweh, for discerning His purposes and for prophetic revelation.  Ezekiel 26:1;  29:17;  Haggai 1:1. 

They were days of assembly and God dealt with Israel at these times, speaking through His servants, the Prophets. 
 
We are also told in the New Testament these days are prophetic and foreshadow future events.  (Colossians 2:16-17)  The celebration of the new moon has great prophetic significance for Israel as the Bride of Yahweh and it was/is an appointed time of His choosing to give prophetic revelation to His people of His purposes for them.
 
The New Moon and the Sabbath were closely linked as both were holy, set-apart days unto Yahweh Himself and the celebration of the new moon is placed in importance in the scriptures alongside keeping the Sabbath.  It is not cited in the Torah until Numbers chapter 10 because it is a celebration based upon the testimony of Yahweh's corporate people being established as His luminary in the world.  Yahweh called Israel to be a light to the Gentiles, a holy, set-apart nation which reflected His glorious light (Exodus 19: ; 1 Peter 2: 4-5).  At the beginning of each month they were called to come aside from their normal functions for existence in this world, to reflect upon their ordained purpose of reflecting His presence in the world and revitalizing their spiritual lives in Him.

Joseph was given a dream of the sun, moon and stars as it related to their initial household of faith (Gen. 37: 9). This is carried through into its fulfillment in Revelation 12 with the woman (God's corporate people) arrayed with the glory of the sun (representing the glory of the Father), with her feet standing upon the moon (the reflected light of the sun), and the deputation of the twelve stars of His government assigned to her.  This portrays that the woman (Yahweh's Bride) in the end days will have come into the glory of the Father in her witness and testimony as the light-bearer of the Son (sun) in her earthly commission (standing upon the moon - i.e. established in her testimony as being THE light to this world).   

As His Bride keeps this feast of her appointment with Yahweh and comes into alignment with Him, she will reflect His light in ever increasing degrees of magnitude, until she actually shines with the glory of the Son of righteousness. &quot;But we all with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of Yahweh.&quot;   2 Corinthians 3:18

==Celebrating the New Moon==
The beginning of the month is determined by the conjunction of the moon and for it's commencement  the shofar is blown in one long blast.  Numbers 10:10  states that the trumpets should be blown at all New Moons to sanctify the day and the offerings.  The new month is announced and brethren commence to fellowship.   After the blessing is said, greetings of peace are given to one another.  A traditional greeting of peace is Shalom Alechem! (peace be with you)  The response is Alechem Shalom! (upon you peace)

It is a time of fresh dedication of ourselves to Yahweh and of blessing Him and seeking His direction for the new month ahead.  We also take this time to ask His blessings on the planned endeavors for the coming month.  

These days are sanctified or set apart as days of sacrifice, for worship, for assembly and for us to make our spiritual offerings to Yahweh.  (2 Chronicles 2:4; Nehemiah 10:33; Ezekiel 44:24; 45:17)

It is now a spiritual act in a spiritual Temple, which makes it more powerful and just as important, as now we see its real significance in preparing us for the kingdom to come.

Traditionally there is singing and dancing in celebration of the occasion,  and the partaking of a festive meal together with suggested scripture reading of Deuteronomy 4: 7-9;  Psalm 104;  and Psalm 81

They were days of festivity,  as Psalm 81  portrays --  To the chief Musician upon Gittith, (guitar)  A Psalm of Asaph.  &quot;Sing for joy to God our strength! Shout to the God of Ya`akov! Start the music! Beat the drum! Play the sweet lyre and the lute! Sound the shofar at Rosh-Hodesh '''and''' at full moon for the pilgrim feast, because this is a law for Isra'el, a ruling of the God of Ya`akov.&quot; Ps. 81:1-4

They were a &quot;joyous occasion&quot; (Numbers 10:10), so much so that Yahweh threatened to take away these festive times, in punishment for their disobedience (Hosea 2:13). 

The New Moon of Trumpets (Yom Teruah) was also a day of restoration (or reading) of the Law of God.  (Nehemiah 8: 2)

A cleansing process began in the physical temple with the commencement of the new year and this points towards the spiritual cleansing of the spiritual Temple.  We are that spiritual Temple and the process of cleansing begins with us on the First New Moon of each year as a preparation for the coming Passover season.  It then is repeated throughout the year from New Moon to New Moon as we each come before Yahweh and renew our life in Him.  (Ezekiel 45:18; Numbers 28:11)   This will continue in the 1000 year reign of Yeshua. (Isaiah 66:22-23)

The New Moons of the other months of the year are similar to Sabbath days in which no trade or unnecessary work is done.  (Amos 8:5; Nehemiah 10:31)
[work which has to be done is allowed on the new moon]
 

Yahweh keeps His appointments with those who choose to meet with Him at His designated times and He enters His assembly at these times on these holy days of the Sabbaths and the New Moons to fulfill the spiritual reality of these feasts in the lives of His people.  (Ezekiel 46: 1-6)

== New words pronounciation ==

Hello, I find useful these learning books but I think the new words should be somehow linked to the pronounciation (attach the ogg from or link to wictionary.org sounds).

I'm trying to learn Dutch and the pronounciation is kind of difficult to guess :-D

What do you think? --[[User:Tct13|Tct13]] ([[User talk:Tct13|talk]]) 10:43, 25 April 2009 (UTC)

:I think that most language courses without links to audio files by native speakers are basically useless. (There are exceptions like dead languages or books about grammar.) This is probably the most important limitation of most of the wikibooks about foreign language learning. Unfortunately, neither wictionary nor wikimedia commons include pronounciations of a sufficiently large set of words. Furthermore, complete sentences would also be important for language learning. What can be done about it? Contributors should provide samples in their native language and appropriately licensed content should be uploaded to wikimedia commons. Moreover, authors of language learning books should be aware of this problem and find a solution &lt;b&gt;before&lt;/b&gt; they start writing a course on language learning. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:40, 27 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;SERVICE FOR DECLARATION OF THE NEW MOON&lt;/big&gt;
			
The service begins when three stars are normally visible in the sky, and at nightfall whenever the stars are not visible. The new moon may be observed by the calendar's astronomical calculations.

1.  OPENING PRAYER

Leader:   We celebrate the festival of the New Moon as an appointment with Yahweh God, as He has commanded us. 

Blessed are You, Yahweh our God, God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,  Our Father, we fervently call upon You. You are the Great and Mighty One, Most High God, whose Name alone is Yahweh, the Eternal One,  God of Hosts.

You are merciful and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness and keeping covenant forever with those who fear Your Name and keep Your commandments. You made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm.  Nothing is too difficult for You. You are all-powerful to save and You bestow gracious favours to your people, in love.  You are holy and Your name is holy and we separate ourselves this night to come before You to honour, revere and praise Your holy Name.

All:  Blessed are You, Yahweh our God, God of Gods and Lord of Lords, the Holy One of Israel.

Leader:  You have called us to this appointed time to offer unto You sacrifices and offerings and to rejoice before You in the salvation of our souls which You have provided through Y'shua our Messiah.

You have given us the beginning of months as a season of expiation, of atonement for sin and renewal of our consecration in offering an acceptable sacrifice of our lives to You upon Your altar.

All:  Blessed are You Yahweh, our God, King of the universe, who has kept us and sustained us and enabled us to keep this appointment with You.

Leader:  Accept us Your people we pray, and let our prayers come before You and may our worship be acceptable in Your Presence. We ask that You would restore Your holy sanctuary upon earth and dwell with us once more in Your glory.

May we have the blessing of  beholding Your return to Zion when You will restore Your divine glory upon her.

All:  We bless and praise You for Your eternal counsels when You will have compassion upon Your people and restore Your glory once again upon Zion and Your kingdom shall be exalted over all.

2.  READING OF PSALM 81: 1-5

3.  BLOW SHOFAR

Leader:  &quot;Also in the day of your gladness, in your appointed feasts, and at the beginning of your months, you shall blow the shofar over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifice of your peace offerings; and they shall be a memorial for you before your God:  I am Yahweh your God.&quot;   Numbers 10:10   :(all gather outside to observe the new moon where the shofar is blown in every direction turning once clockwise to announce Rosh Chodesh. The service may be concluded inside) 

All:  Blessed are the people that know the sound of the shofar, O Lord. 
:We shall walk in the light of Your countenance, O Lord.

4.  THE SHEMA  Deuteronomy 6: 4-6

Sung:  Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai Eh-lo-hay-nu Adonai e-chad. Ba-ruch shame k'vode mahl-choo-toe l'oh-lahm vah-ed. 
:Sh'ma Yisrael, Adonai Eh-lo-hay-nu Adonai e-chad.

Recited:  Hear O' Israel, Yahweh is our God, the Lord is One. Blessed is the Name of His glorious Kingdom for all eternity. Hear Israel, the Lord our God is one.

5.  LIGHTING THE MENORAH

Leader:  To separate Rosh Chodesh (the New Moon) from the rest of the month, we light the seven branches of the Menorah as a representation of the fullness of the Shekinah glory in the seven spirits of God which will illuminate the New Jerusalem.

We come before You Almighty God this night thanking You that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Y'shua our Messiah and in Him is hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and we are believing tonight that as we light the Menorah that You would impart to us an  increasing measure of Your Spirit  to shine in our hearts and to fill these earthen vessels  of ours with Your glory so that the illumination of Your Presence will be manifest through us.  (Colossians 2: 3, 9-10; 1:27)

We ask that You would impart unto us &quot;the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Y'shua, so that the eyes of our understanding might be enlightened to know what is the hope of His calling and the riches of the glory of His inheritance in us; And what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power,&quot; &quot;so that we might be strengthened with might through His Spirit in our inner man , that Messiah may dwell in our hearts through faith and that we might comprehend and really experience the love of Messiah which passes knowledge; .. .. and be filled with all the fullness of God.&quot;   (Ephesians 1:17-19; 3:16-19)
:(Leader invokes the blessing of each of the seven spirits of God from Isaiah 11: 1-2 upon those present lighting each corresponding candle as the people by faith, receive the blessing)

Leader:  Would you fill us Your people this night with the Spirit of the Lord ;  (light first candle etc.)
:(wisdom; understanding; counsel; might; knowledge; and the fear of Yahweh God)

Response:  We receive the spirit of wisdom; (understanding; counsel; might; knowledge; and the fear of Yahweh God)	

6.  SCRIPTURE READING

Ezekiel 45 :17, 46: 1-6;  Isaiah 66:22-24

7.  SANCTIFICATION OF THE MONTH

Leader:  May it be Your will, Yahweh our God, and God of our fathers, that we begin this month with the pardoning of sin and the forgiveness of iniquity. Bless and sanctify this new month to us and to all Your people with joy and gladness, with blessing and provision for all our needs in peace and in prosperity.

Unite our hearts to fear Your Name so that we will keep Your commandments and walk in the paths of righteousness for Your honour and  to receive Your blessing.

We long for that day when the Torah will go forth from Zion to all nations, when darkness will flee away, when the saints of the Most High will possess the Kingdom, when You will destroy those who destroy of the earth, when wars will forever cease, when justice and righteousness will fill the earth as the waters cover the sea and when “Yahweh will be King over all the earth, and His Name One.”  And let us all say, Amein.

All:  We express our gratitude to You, Creator of the universe, for the renewal of our lives and the hope we have in You for the coming month.  Blessed are You,  Who sanctifies Your people Israel in the beginning of the month.

8.  PETITIONS

All:   Oh Yahweh our God, we call upon You this day to hear our prayer for forgiveness for all our shortcomings, for all our transgressions and  for all our sins. 
For Your holy Name's sake and for Zion's sake, and for Your people, and for all mankind.  
We turn to You and seek Your compassion and Your mercy, Yahweh, our Rock and our Redeemer.  Hear our prayer!

Leader:  O Yahweh, God of our fathers and our God, we ask that in this coming month that you would, 
:*give us what we need spiritually to grow into Your likeness;
:*that You would give us what we need  emotionally to walk in Your ways;
:*that You would give us what we need  mentally to be conscious of You and Your Word  at all times;
:*that You would give us what we need financially so that we would have sufficient for ourselves and can bless others;	
:*that You would give us what we need physically so we can serve You faithfully and glorify You in all we do, Amein.

9.  BLESSING OF THE WINE

Leader:  Yahweh is the Incomprehensible One, before the beginning of the creative process He was and ever shall be.  Our Heavenly Father, the great Creator, chose to emerge from dwelling in the unapproachable light of eternity and reveal Himself through His creation, His manifestation of light into the world.

&quot;For it is God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Y'shua the Messiah.  But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us&quot;   2 Corinthians 4: 6-7

&quot;Y'shua said, I am the Vine and you are the branches, He who abides in Me and I in him, bears much fruit:&quot;  John 15: 5a

All:  Blessed are You Yahweh our God, King of the universe, who creates the fruit of the vine.   (Pass the cup of blessing)

10.  BLESSING OF THE BREAD

&quot;He has in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high: Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.&quot;   (Hebrews 1:2-4)

&quot;For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through suffering.  For both He that sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one, for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren.&quot;   (Hebrews 2:10-11)

All:  Blessed are You, Yahweh our God, King of the universe, who resurrects Bread from the earth.   (Pass the bread)

Blessed are You Yahweh, for sanctifying us Your people in the renewal of our lives this month.

11.  THANKSGIVING AND PRAISE

We thank You and praise You for the redemption which You have provided in Y'shua our Messiah and for all the  mighty acts which You have performed on our behalf and the victories which You have given us in our lives both at this time and in the previous times. You are a mighty God and Saviour and all who live shall thank You and praise Your Name in truth.

Blessed are You, O Yahweh, God of our salvation and our Succourer.  
You are Good and worthy to be praised and we give thanks unto You for all Your great benefits to us. 
 
:(Time for personal testimonies)

12.  FESTIVE MEAL 
:(Grace after the meal)

13.  DEVOTIONS AND WORSHIP

14.  PRIESTLY BLESSING    Numbers 6:24-26

He who exists will kneel before you presenting gifts and will guard you with a hedge of protection.

He who exists will illuminate you with the wholeness of His Being, bringing order (shalom), and He will beautify you.

He who exists will lift up the wholeness of His Being and look upon you to set in place all you need to be whole and complete.  
:(a translation by Jeff Bennett from the Paleo Hebrew script)







For Rosh Chodesh a seven stick menorah is used to set it apart from the Sabbath. Seven candles mounted on a plate can be used as a substitute.
(Based upon the standard Jewish New Moon service using suggestions for the service by Mike Clayton)

[[image:MachineKnittingAnSofi.jpg?|center]]
This text is not about ready patterns, but a guide as to how you can produce your own patterns. It is my hope that it will be a useful reference for many years to come, regardless of changing fashions.

I have organized the text with the easiest things first. This is so in the chapter on [[Machine_Knitting/Knitting_samples|Knitting samples]], and in the following text about knitting from specific measurements, which I have divided into two chapters. The first of these, [[Machine_Knitting/Knitting_to_measure|Knitting to measure]], is for those who just want to concentrate on knitting straightforward jumpers in the easiest way possible, whilst in the later chapter, [[Machine_Knitting/Garment_patterns|Garment patterns]], I have written about fitting methods and how to create a basic pattern from that, firstly, showing the easiest method of doing this, and later telling how from the basic pattern, you can make alterations and adjustments. In this way, it is my hope that there is something for everyone. You may then use whatever part of it you want to use, but a condition for understanding the text is that you have read the chapter about [[Machine_Knitting/Knitting_samples|Knitting samples]], because it is a basic idea behind the whole text that you use your own knitting sample for all measurements.

But of course, there are many ways of making things, and the methods described should be conceived just as suggestions.

I hope that with this book, I can spare someone for making all the same mistakes as I have made myself during the 40 years that I have been machine-knitting.

Many thanks to my son Agner who has helped me with illustrations and advice and published this on the web, and to my son Kåre who has made an admirable effort to help with the translation.

This book was originally written in Danish ([[http://da.wikibooks.org/wiki/Maskinstrikning]]). The English translation has been carried out mainly by my son Kåre and other family members who have helped with translation and linguistic corrections. However, it has been difficult to find correct translations for many technical expressions, and I apologize for any misleading translations. I would be happy if somebody will correct and improve the English translation.

== Ingredients ==

*1 dl peanuts
*1 ml sea salt
*10 dl water

== Utensils ==

*a blender
*a colander
*a fine filter of some sort, e.g. a reusable coffee filter
*a funnel
*two bottles

== Procedure ==

# Rinse peanuts in colander. If salted peanuts are used, rinse well with hot water.
# Place peanuts in blender with half of the water, and blend on high speed for about 1-2 minutes.
# Add the rest of the water and blend on high speed for maybe 1 minute, until smooth.
# Pour into a bottle, add the salt, shake, and put in the fridge for a few hours.
# When most of the peanut flour has settled at the bottom of the bottle, pour carefully through a filter into another bottle.
# When the filter starts clogging with peanut flour, squeeze out the milk, and rinse the filter. You can also use a spoon or something similar in the filter to help most of the milk get through before squeezing.

== Notes == 
*Additional sweetener or other flavouring, e.g., vanilla, may be added to taste.
*The sea salt takes away the watery feeling. It should not taste salt. You can experiment as to what amount is right for you.
*The same goes for the thickness of the milk. Add more or less water to taste.
*Peanuts are extremely nutritious, and do not have the same health issues as soy.

==What is a knitting machine?==
[[image:MachineKnittingKnittax.jpg?|center]]
A knitting machine is a long apparatus furnished with a row of hooked needles, or rather, casting-on needles. Usually there are 200 needles. They sit in a base which is called the needle bed. A part of the needle (the butt) protrudes through the needle bed and it is this which makes contact with the knitting carriage. The carriage, which is pushed across the stitches, has on its underside several 'cams' which govern the movement each needle will make as the carriage is moved across the bed. Every needle has a latch which may be tilted back and forth, whereby it opens and closes the access to the hook of the needle. The stitches sit in the hooks, and when you drive the carriage across the needles, they first are pushed up into the upper position, whereby the stitches push back the latches. Next, the yarn feeder lays new thread into the hooks. After that, the needles are pushed down again, whereby the old stitches push the latches forward, shutting off the needle hooks and sliding out over the needles. At this moment, the new stitches have been formed. In the oldest machines, these cams were quite simple, and therefore the machines could do little but knit forwards and backwards. Newer machines have various buttons that you can move or push in order to change the needle routes. This allows for textured and multi-coloured patterning. For instance the needles may be pushed completely forward, whereby they slip into a trail where they are not included in the knitting - unless you move another button, which again includes them. On older machines, you have to include them manually.

'''The needles have four possible positions:'''
; 'Out of work' position
: Those needles that are out of use are pushed completely back.
; Working position
: Brought forward about 1/2&quot;.
; Idling position, or upper working position
: Precisely so much forward that the stitches just do not enter behind the latches.
; Resting position (or holding position)
: Completely forward.

Some machine instructions use other designations, e.g. letter designations, but as the instructions of different machines use different terminologies, I have chosen to use the terms mentioned above.

In some machines, the system differs somewhat, e.g. PASSAP. But the system described above is the most common.

The oldest types that I have seen, are the so-called double-bed machines. The name refers to the fact that there are two needle beds, i.e. those bottoms on which the needles sit. The two apparatuses are oriented towards each other, at a slant upwards towards their midline. While you are working, the wrongside of the knitting faces outward. When there are two machines oriented towards each other, the front one will have its rightside facing the knitting person, but you cannot see that, because the knitting is between the machines. This means that one may have every other stitch on the foremost machine and every other on the hindmost, i.e. knit 1 plain and 1 purl, 2 plain and 2 purl, or other combinations. Or you may make circular knitting. The oldest machines demanded that very heavy weights were hung on the knitting, and if you knitted plain knitting, you would also have to attach side weights that must be moved for every tenth row. The foremost machine could be detached if you wanted to knit plain knitting. In very old machines, the needles could not be put into resting position, and even older machines did not have the idling position either.

Later, some more practical machines appeared. Various sorts of casting-off systems were invented, which helped so that you did not have to use so heavy weights, but you could not completely do without weights. On the knitter (the hindmost apparatus), it is possible to knit without weights. If you knit on both apparatuses, you need, with most machines, to use weights, but not as heavy as with the oldest machines. In many cases you also have to use weights with a single-bed machine, particularly if you knit patterns, but what you use is only a light comb, upon which small, light side weights are hung.

But one machine had a completely different system. This was KNITTAX. It did not use weights, but, instead of that, springs that sat in between every needle and held the stitches; and when the carriage was led across, it tilted the springs upwards and down again, so that they held the next row while the machine was knitting. KNITTAX was a single-bed machine. A ribber for it was available, but it was placed vertically in front of the single-bed apparatus and could still utilize the springs, so it did not need weights. But it had only every other needle, so you could not knit more than one combination of knit and purl rows - it was meant only for rib borders with 1 knit and 1 purl, and for fisherman's rib (In German and Scandinavian languages, this is called &quot;patent knitting&quot;. It seems that &quot;fisherman's rib&quot; is the English word for it, but a dictionary had the term &quot;raised ribbing&quot;). The rib apparatus had no resting position. KNITTAX was a fine machine. It was easy to knit with, but it had no automatics. The needle distance was approx. 5 mm. The first machines that appeared did not have a yarn feeder. You had to put the thread by hand. This was possible because it had another knitting position than other machines; it knitted with the stitches behind the latches. This, plus a slightly larger needle distance, implied that you could use slightly thicker yarn. Eventually, machines with yarn feeder also appeared. If you want to buy a second-hand KNITTAX, you must check that it has a yarn feeder. KNITTAX also produced some smaller machines meant for baby clothing. They had too few needles to allow you to knit a large adult size.

Later, PASSAP took up the idea of having springs instead of weights. This was a double-bed machine that could knit rib without weights, but weights existed for it in case they were needed. It was the only machine that was able to knit patterns in circular knitting. It had slightly differing needle positions. It was an excellent machine, but the producers were not smart enough to follow up when the electronics appeared, so the result was that it was run down by the Japanese.

Today, the machines on the market in my country are mostly Japanese; therefore, this text is mainly about these. ROYAL and BROTHER are the most common, but others have been awailable which are no longer imported, e.g. JUKI. Japanese machines have a needle distance of 4½ mm. You may buy them as single-bed machines, which, in that case, are placed flat on the table. If you buy an accessory ribber, you have to slant the machine slightly. With the machine follows a clamp with which it can be lifted up in an upwards-slanted position, allowing the ribber, which is also slanted, to be attached. Of course, the ribber may be detached again, but that is not necessary, for it can be lowered, so that you can manage.

You can buy machines with punch cards that extend over 24 stitches. These are probably the most sold models, but they are also available with diskettes with countless patterns extending over the entire machine. You may make your own patterns on punch cards as well as diskettes. There have also been machines with print cards, i.e. transparent sheets with small squares where you could draw your patterns with a special pen. They extended over 60 stitches. Unfortunately, they are not available anymore. This is a shame, because here you had a better overview over your drawings. The latest new machines require that you have a computer screen if you want to see the entire pattern at a time.

With ROYAL, all patterns have to be made on punch cards; you can do nothing manually. With BROTHER, all needles are first pushed up into idling position, and the pattern is knitted in the row that follows. Thereby, you can always see what the machine will do in the next row and have a chance to correct something, if you want. You may also make simple patterns without having them on punch cards by pushing up the needles manually. Since March 2000, BROTHER is not imported anymore, but they have issued a guarantee that spare parts will be available for the next 10 years. The new models of ROYAL are now called SILVER REED.

Some older Japanese models had pattern buttons for a 6, 8 or 12 stitch pattern repeat. You could enter a pattern repeat once, and when you pulled a handle or a switch, the needles came into working position all over the machine, allowing you to knit a pattern over them. You may probably be able to find a second-hand machine of this type, if you are interested. But later, it became possible to knit a large single pattern (up to 200 needles on certain machines eg Brother 950i electronic), so machines were constructed that could meet this demand.

===Yarn===
The most popular knitting machines have 4.5mm spacing between needles and are designed to knit from a 2-ply laceweight yarn through to 4-ply fingering yarn. It is possible to use Double Knitting (worsted) yarn but knitted on every other needle only.

There are 9mm spaced machines known as 'chunky knitters' usually having 150 - 180 needles that will knit from double knit through to very chunky yarn.

Yarns designed for machine knitting are usually wound onto cones. They are available from very fine single ply through to chunky quality. Several threads of finer yarn can be knitted together to create a thicker fabric if desired.
